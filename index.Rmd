# About this book

This book is under development. It will eventually cover:

-   Survey methods for complex data (e.g., NHANES, DHS)
-   Interrupted time series for policy evaluation
-   Health services and policy applications (drones, oxygen systems, etc.)

I will be using R in all demonstrations. I will trt to make things easier to understand for non-statistical background.
