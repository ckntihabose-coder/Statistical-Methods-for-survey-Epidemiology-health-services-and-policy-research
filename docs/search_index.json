You can have as many as you want within a chapter. An unnumbered section Chapters and sections are numbered by default. To un-number a heading, add a {.unnumbered} or the shorter {-} at the end of the heading, like in this section.

DHS uses a cluster sampling methodology to obtain nationally representative data on population, health, and nutrition. Once completed, results are published and can be accessible by researchers. When access is given, a researcher can download and save data files. The next process of using data required statistical skills that will be described here. 3.2.1 Data importing The analysis utilizes data from five waves of the Rwanda Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) spanning two decades (2000–2020). I imported the official SAS-formatted raw data files (.SAS7BDAT) for each cycle year into R using the haven package, verifying the file dimensions upon import for consistency. The first step is to explore the file. The command was used to list the files that are contained within the specified directory path. list.files(&quot;/Users/corneille/Desktop/Mike lab/DHS/1992/RWBR21SD&quot;) ## [1] &quot;RWBR21FL.frq&quot; &quot;RWBR21FL.frw&quot; &quot;RWBR21FL.MAP&quot; ## [4] &quot;RWBR21FL.SAS&quot; &quot;RWBR21FL.SAS7BDAT&quot; The library(haven) loads the haven package into the current R session.The haven package is essential because it provides functions (like read_sas) necessary to import data files saved in formats used by other statistical software, such as SAS (Statistical Analysis System), SPSS, and Stata. The following lines read and load five different SAS data files (indicated by the .SAS7BDAT file extension) into the R environment, creating five separate data frames: library(haven) data2000 &lt;- read_sas(&quot;/Users/corneille/Desktop/Mike lab/DHS/2000/RWBR41SD/RWBR41FL.SAS7BDAT&quot;) data2005 &lt;- read_sas(&quot;/Users/corneille/Desktop/Mike lab/DHS/2005/RWBR53SD/RWBR53FL.SAS7BDAT&quot;) data2010 &lt;- read_sas(&quot;/Users/corneille/Desktop/Mike lab/DHS/2010/RWBR61SD/RWBR61FL.SAS7BDAT&quot;) data2015 &lt;- read_sas(&quot;/Users/corneille/Desktop/Mike lab/DHS/2015/RWBR70SD/RWBR70FL.SAS7BDAT&quot;) data2020 &lt;- read_sas(&quot;/Users/corneille/Desktop/Mike lab/DHS/2020/RWBR81SD/RWBR81FL.SAS7BDAT&quot;) Finally, The five commands were executed to inspect the dimensions (number of rows and columns) of each of the newly loaded data frames. This is a crucial initial step to verify that the data was imported correctly and to understand the size of each dataset (rows = number of observations/survey participants; columns = number of variables/questions). dim(data2000) ## [1] 27602 934 dim(data2005) ## [1] 30072 1077 dim(data2010) ## [1] 32639 1021 dim(data2015) ## [1] 30058 1078 dim(data2020) ## [1] 30820 1216 "],["parts.html", "4 Parts", " 4 Parts You can add parts to organize one or more book chapters together. Parts can be inserted at the top of an .Rmd file, before the first-level chapter heading in that same file. Add a numbered part: # (PART) Act one {-} (followed by # A chapter) Add an unnumbered part: # (PART\\*) Act one {-} (followed by # A chapter) Add an appendix as a special kind of un-numbered part: # (APPENDIX) Other stuff {-} (followed by # A chapter). Chapters in an appendix are prepended with letters instead of numbers.

Like this one 1. 5.2 Citations Reference items in your bibliography file(s) using @key. For example, we are using the bookdown package (Xie 2025) (check out the last code chunk in index.Rmd to see how this citation key was added) in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and knitr (Xie 2015) (this citation was added manually in an external file book.bib). Note that the .bib files need to be listed in the index.Rmd with the YAML bibliography key. The bs4_book theme makes footnotes appear inline when you click on them. In this example book, we added csl: chicago-fullnote-bibliography.csl to the index.Rmd YAML, and include the .csl file.

If you’d like to customize your 404 page instead of using the default, you may add either a _404.Rmd or _404.md file to your project root and use code and/or Markdown syntax. 7.3 Metadata for sharing Bookdown HTML books will provide HTML metadata for social sharing on platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn, using information you provide in the index.Rmd YAML. To setup, set the url for your book and the path to your cover-image file. Your book’s title and description are also used. This bs4_book provides enhanced metadata for social sharing, so that each chapter shared will have a unique description, auto-generated based on the content. Specify your book’s source repository on GitHub as the repo in the _output.yml file, which allows users to view each chapter’s source file or suggest an edit. Read more about the features of this output format here: https://pkgs.rstudio.com/bookdown/reference/bs4_book.html Or use: ?bookdown::bs4_book This gitbook uses the same social sharing data across all chapters in your book- all links shared will look the same. Specify your book’s source repository on GitHub using the edit key under the configuration options in the _output.yml file, which allows users to suggest an edit by linking to a chapter’s source file.
