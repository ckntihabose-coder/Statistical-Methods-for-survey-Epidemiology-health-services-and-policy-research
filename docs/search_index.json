It will eventually cover: Survey methods for complex data (e.g., NHANES, DHS) Interrupted time series for policy evaluation Health services and policy applications (drones, oxygen systems, etc.) I will be using R in all demonstrations. I will trt to make things easier to understand for non-statistical background. "],["introduction.html", "2 Introduction", " 2 Introduction This book presents practical statistical methods for analyzing survey data and evaluating health policies, with a focus on applications in epidemiology and health services research. The motivating examples are drawn from three main data sources: National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) Routine health information systems and policy evaluations from Rwanda The goal is to bridge the gap between methods textbooks and real analytic workflows. Throughout the book, we will: Work with complex survey designs (weights, strata, PSUs) Fit regression models commonly used in epidemiology Implement interrupted time series (ITS) and controlled ITS designs Apply methods to real questions in maternal and child health, non-communicable diseases, and health system performance R is used for all demonstrations. Code examples are written to be reproducible and annotated so that readers with limited statistical background can follow the logic step by step. "],["survey-methods.html", "3 Survey Methods 3.1 Demographic Health Surveys (DHS)", " 3 Survey Methods This chapter introduces statistical methods for the analysis of complex survey data. We focus on two widely used data sources in global and population health: National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) We start by briefly describing survey design features—stratification, clustering, and weighting—and why they matter for valid estimation and inference. We then demonstrate: How to import and prepare NHANES and DHS data in R How to specify the survey design using the survey package How to obtain design-corrected descriptive statistics and regression models The emphasis is on reproducible workflows that you can adapt to your own survey analyses. 3.1 Demographic Health Surveys (DHS) Demographic Health Surveys (DHS) is a survey that is implemented in many developing countries. DHS uses a cluster sampling methodology to obtain nationally representative data on population, health, and nutrition. Once completed, results are published and can be accessible by researchers. When access is given, a researcher can download and save data files. The next process of using data required statistical skills that will be described here. 3.1.1 Data importing The analysis utilizes data from five waves of the Rwanda Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) spanning two decades (2000–2020). I imported the official SAS-formatted raw data files (.SAS7BDAT) for each cycle year into R using the haven package, verifying the file dimensions upon import for consistency. The first step is to explore the file. The command was used to list the files that are contained within the specified directory path. list.files(&quot;/Users/corneille/Desktop/Mike lab/DHS/1992/RWBR21SD&quot;) ## [1] &quot;RWBR21FL.frq&quot; &quot;RWBR21FL.frw&quot; &quot;RWBR21FL.MAP&quot; &quot;RWBR21FL.SAS&quot; ## [5] &quot;RWBR21FL.SAS7BDAT&quot; The library(haven) loads the haven package into the current R session.The haven package is essential because it provides functions (like read_sas) necessary to import data files saved in formats used by other statistical software, such as SAS (Statistical Analysis System), SPSS, and Stata. The following lines read and load five different SAS data files (indicated by the .SAS7BDAT file extension) into the R environment, creating five separate data frames: library(haven) data2000 &lt;- read_sas(&quot;/Users/corneille/Desktop/Mike lab/DHS/2000/RWBR41SD/RWBR41FL.SAS7BDAT&quot;) data2005 &lt;- read_sas(&quot;/Users/corneille/Desktop/Mike lab/DHS/2005/RWBR53SD/RWBR53FL.SAS7BDAT&quot;) data2010 &lt;- read_sas(&quot;/Users/corneille/Desktop/Mike lab/DHS/2010/RWBR61SD/RWBR61FL.SAS7BDAT&quot;) data2015 &lt;- read_sas(&quot;/Users/corneille/Desktop/Mike lab/DHS/2015/RWBR70SD/RWBR70FL.SAS7BDAT&quot;) data2020 &lt;- read_sas(&quot;/Users/corneille/Desktop/Mike lab/DHS/2020/RWBR81SD/RWBR81FL.SAS7BDAT&quot;) Finally, The five commands were executed to inspect the dimensions (number of rows and columns) of each of the newly loaded data frames. This is a crucial initial step to verify that the data was imported correctly and to understand the size of each dataset (rows = number of observations/survey participants; columns = number of variables/questions). dim(data2000) ## [1] 27602 934 dim(data2005) ## [1] 30072 1077 dim(data2010) ## [1] 32639 1021 dim(data2015) ## [1] 30058 1078 dim(data2020) ## [1] 30820 1216 "],["epidemiology-methods.html", "4 Epidemiology Methods 4.1 Dataset exploration", " 4 Epidemiology Methods 4.1 Dataset exploration We will use the data from NHANES for demonstration, specifically demographic data. The first step, is to pull data from CDC website using nhanesA package. I will save the data into demo library(nhanesA) demo &lt;- nhanes(&quot;DEMO&quot;, translated = TRUE) It is possible to explore the data pulled. There are various ways such as exploring dimensions. This will show you how many rows do you have in your dataset, and number columns. Specifically, for “demo”, we have 9,965 rows and 144 columns. library(nhanesA) dim(demo) ## [1] 9965 144 It is also possible, to look at structure of the dataset, even far, looking the structure of each variable. Here, I mean the type of variable; numerical, factor, integer,…. This way will also show you how if some missing values are present. To look at entire structure, the analysst can use str(demo), however, because here we have 144 columns, we will present only 10 variables. str(demo[, 1:10]) ## &#39;data.frame&#39;: 9965 obs. of 10 variables: ## $ SEQN : num 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ... ## $ SDDSRVYR: Factor w/ 1 level &quot;NHANES 1999-2000 Public Release&quot;: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... ## $ RIDSTATR: Factor w/ 2 levels &quot;Interviewed Only&quot;,..: 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 ... ## $ RIDEXMON: Factor w/ 2 levels &quot;November 1 through April 30&quot;,..: 2 2 1 2 2 2 2 1 2 2 ... ## $ RIAGENDR: Factor w/ 2 levels &quot;Male&quot;,&quot;Female&quot;: 2 1 2 1 1 2 2 1 2 1 ... ## $ RIDAGEYR: num 2 77 10 1 49 19 59 13 11 43 ... ## $ RIDAGEMN: num 29 926 125 22 597 230 712 159 133 518 ... ## $ RIDAGEEX: num 31 926 126 23 597 230 712 160 133 518 ... ## $ RIDRETH1: Factor w/ 5 levels &quot;Mexican American&quot;,..: 4 3 3 4 3 5 4 3 4 4 ... ## $ RIDRETH2: Factor w/ 5 levels &quot;Non-Hispanic White&quot;,..: 2 1 1 2 1 4 2 1 2 2 ... You can also exploring percentage of missing values for each variable. To visualize this you must use “plot_missing”. To perform this, you need library(DataExplorer). For all variables, this operation can be done plot_missing (demo). However, for simplicity, we will present only 15 variables. library(DataExplorer) # Visualization plot_missing ( demo[, 1:15]) "],["health-services.html", "5 Health Services", " 5 Health Services "],["interrupted-time-series-analysis.html", "6 Interrupted Time series analysis", " 6 Interrupted Time series analysis "],["nhanes.html", "7 NHANES", " 7 NHANES "],["demographic-health-survey-dhs.html", "8 Demographic Health Survey (DHS)", " 8 Demographic Health Survey (DHS) "],["missing-data.html", "9 Missing Data", " 9 Missing Data "],["appendix.html", "10 Appendix", " 10 Appendix "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
